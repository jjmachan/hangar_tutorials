# Hangar Tutorials
The nbs accompanying the Hangar Tutorial series. 

This is a set of notebooks I made for my Hangar Tutorials. I explain the basic concepts of Hangar, its notion of columns
and the basic APIs and also show how to add data to Hangar and then in the second notebook I show how to train a model 
using the data stored in Hangar. We also do a quick comparison of the dataloader speeds and the file sizes of the data.

I'm using `python=3.7`, `hangar=0.5.1`  and `PyTorch=1.4.0+cpu`
